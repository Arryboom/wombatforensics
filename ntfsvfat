PAPER (working)

TITLE: A Comparison of the NTFS and FAT32 File Systems

Introduction: This paper will begin describing what a file system is and the concepts that most file systems follow. Once a basic understanding of file systems has been established, NTFS and FAT32 cannot be compared without clearly defining the two filesystems. After each file system is clearly defined, then there is data available to compare NTFS and FAT32. As is listed in the title, the NTFS and FAT32 file systems will be explained in detail, starting with NTFS. When discussing file systems, NTFS is considered to be complex and FAT32 is considered to be simple.  "Why are they considered to be complex or simple?" will be evident when each filesystem has been defined.  NTFS will be covered in detail first because it is complex and will require more explanation.  FAT32 will be covered
