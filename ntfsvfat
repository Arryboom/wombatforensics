7. In what case would there be a use for either system from a user perspective and a forensic perspective

USEFULE NOTES TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WRITING IT.

essential data and non-essential data required to save and retrieve files.
logical file address. slack space. unallocated space. wiping techniques.

FAT Boot Sector Data

cluster and sector addresses.

directory entry/allocation

ease to analyze fat file structure but limits with regards to file recovery and temporal-based auditing.

NTFS everything is a file. MFT

logical file system provides information on where data is stored on the physical disk

TITLE: A Comparison of the NTFS and FAT32 File Systems

1. INTRODUCTION

This paper will begin describing what a file system is and the concepts that most file systems follow. Once a basic understanding of file systems has been established, NTFS and FAT32 cannot be compared without clearly defining the two filesystems. After each file system is clearly defined, then there is data available to compare NTFS and FAT32. As is listed in the title, the NTFS and FAT32 file systems will be explained in detail, starting with NTFS. When discussing file systems, NTFS is considered to be complex and FAT32 is considered to be simple. "Why are they considered to be complex or simple?" will be evident when each filesystem has been defined. NTFS will be covered in detail first because it is complex and will require more explanation. FAT32 will be covered second because it is simpler. (THIS ORDER MAY CHANGE ONCE I DEFINE A FILE SYSTEM IN GENERAL AND THEN DEFINE FAT32 AND NTFS). For the purpose of this paper, a few assumptions will be made that will simplify the number of divergant explanations and definitions required and to provide a common basis for their comparison. The computer in reference will have a hard drive used for storage that contains a singular file system on the Windows XP operating system.

2. GENERAL FILE SYSTEM
A file system is a system that manages storing, retrieving and updating files on a computer.
