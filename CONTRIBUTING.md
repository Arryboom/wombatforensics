Contributions are welcome, Bug reports are welcome, Feature requests are welcome.

I don't have any actual guidelines yet, just try to match my coding style, indenture, etc... Also try to keep your code simple.
I think the simpler the better, and the less chance for bugs. If contributions become a hassle, I'll work on coming up with some
more meaningful guidelines.
